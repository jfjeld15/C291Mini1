Aron Gu's test data from the eClass forums for assignment 2 was used for testing during development of our code.
Otherwise, we did not collaborate with anyone else (Other than questions from other students in the eClass
forum) during this assignment.

USAGE:
- Type into the terminal:
    python3 c291Mini1.py <database_path>
- users will be prompted for various inputs through the terminal, explaining options and input suggestions.
- The program will only run properly if it is run from a directory which includes the files:
    - artistActions.py
    - c291Mini1.py
    - searchArtist.py
    - searchPlaySong.py
    - SQL database file, saved with the .db file extension
